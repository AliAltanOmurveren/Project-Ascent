problem: fixing camera jitter requires average position
    - average position means delayed camera movement
    - delayed camera movement causes to ship's sphere appear relative to camera
    - delayed camera movement messes with ship's collider position
solution: 
    - disable ship's mesh renderer
    * ship's collider is needed because of physics movement
    - add main collider to camera
for future:
    - test camera collider
    - fire weapons from camera
